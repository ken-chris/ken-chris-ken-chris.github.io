<h2>👋 Hi, I'm Ken</h2>

I am a PhD student advised by Alex Mariakakis and Joseph Cafazzo who lead the Computational Health and Interaction (CHAI) lab at the University of Toronto Department of Computer Science and the Centre for E-Health Innovation at the University Health Network respectively.

My research focuses on using the sensors embedded in common devices (e.g., mobile phone, earbud, smartspeaker) and novel machine learning techniques to acquire information relevant to human health as well as exploring how that information is best used to improve health outcomes. I am interested in a broad array of sensing modalities and use cases, please check out my <a href ="{{ '/research' }}">research</a> and <a> projects</a> pages for more.
